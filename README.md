## Abstract

Classification is one of the fields at the forefront of machine learning research. Our daily lives already use advanced data processing models, whether for identifying spam emails or classifying patient diagnoses. This project utilizes a dataset of students of diverse backgrounds containing both qualitative and quantitative aspects. In this paper, we construct and compare the accuracy to classify students falling above or below average in grades with logistic regression, random forest classifier, and KNN classifier models.
